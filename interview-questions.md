# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter is where you put the word of the thing you are trying to call. Like when working in a function, you make a const whatever (word) you use the word "word", kin the function to call on what is going inside, such as a variable. An argument is naming soemthin that makes it an object that can be called on and changed.

  Researched answer:sort of right. So parameter is the value within a function that can be called upon in the function when using the fucntion. Within that parameter you can call the argument. The argument is the value usually defined in a different variable with it;s own value. This is usually what we are running the function for it to run the fucntion on it and get the expected output. 



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: the predefined parameters in .map() are to put an argument inside of them and depending on what it is, for example if you gave it an argument of an arry it would return all the values of that area. so it takes in value, index, and array. I believe value or index are required, but not array.

  Researched answer: the map function returns an array of the argument that was given to it. That part I did not fully remember. I did see that Map and Object were historically about the same thing. But with some differences that made map more preferred. I only say this because Mary and I used ObjectOf in one of our challenges and Austin said Kiss. map takes two parameters, a function and and argument. So i read in the syllabus that value is required and index and array are optional.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: map gets the values within an array and outputs its own array of the new values. where as filter iterates through an array an goes until the condition of a function it was given is met, such as a for loop and returns the new values.

  Researched answer: a more defined answer is that map will give back an array of the same length where a filter will give back values that were true through the condition it was given. map has methods. a lot of methods actually. a couple being clear()-removes all elements from map, delete(key)- removes an element specifiedby the key. and so on. I found filter is an es5 feature which i guess is pretty cool. most places i keep reading about filter say the same thing about it.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: a function is a way to set a condition or to call an argument to run a code and get a different value. a method is a way of inserting a form of something happening to a variable such a s map which I just talked about.

  Researched answer: function is written to perform a task on whatever invokes or calls it. They use parameters to to call an argument so that the task could be ran on that argument. functions are dynamic and can be used with any argument given to them. Methods are a little different because they are a property of an object that conatian a function. So they are an object with which can be access and changed with the . and whatever you gave the name of the method. methods can also be invoked by objects.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: destructing is taking apart whatever is giving to it. so if you give an array, it will piece all the parts in it into separate things.   

  Researched answer: ao this is a powerful tool. you can extract from arrays, objects, and maps. you set them to new variables after you extract them. so you are now able to use these new values in different situations. I did read something about a left-hand side being outputted, but I was having trouble understanding it. I sometimes have to have different people explain the same thing to me to understand it.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I believe hoisting is hosting your own program in javascript

  Researched answer: It was a little confusing to me. But it takes the functions variables and classes to the top of the "scope" before exectuing the code.so i saw it was a way to run codes safely befoer you hve to run the console. So it's kind of like a jest.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: we learned a little about this in class. this is adds to a class parents and makes a child class which takes in the parents values but it can;t give the parent anything. this can be used to change or add something to a class for a specific class.

2. React: react is what we use to make a webpage more usuable and bale to have little changes in it like in facebook when you like something, it allows the thumbs up ot change to red without having to refresh the page.

3. React state:state is an empty component to start off with. it can be used to change what was there. I saw that it counts for what you did basicaly. so if you had a counter, it counts how many times you clicked it.

4. React lifecycle methods: life-cycle has three phases. mounting, updating, unmounting. so when it mounts, it is adding things to the dom which is the html. the updating part updates a component if it is changed or updated and the unmounting part is where the component is removed form the dom. this is all used to keep the dom up to date and functioning properly.

5. DOM: dom stasnd for document object model. the dom has a tress of what is happening in it. it all reacts tp the html it is linked to. it is represented with objects and nodes so that it can be interacted with .
